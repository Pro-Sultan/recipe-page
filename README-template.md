### What I learned

Throughout the course of this project, I embarked on a journey to refine my skills in crafting responsive web designs. A pivotal aspect of this endeavor involved delving into the realm of Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework renowned for its robust set of pre-designed components and responsive grid system.

```html
<div class="preparation_time rounded">
  <p class="fs-4 fw-bold">Preparation time</p>
  <ul class="">
    <li class="" style="color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%)">
      <span class="fw-bolder">Total: </span>Approximately 10 minutes
    </li>
    <li class="" style="color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%)">
      <span class="fw-bolder">Preparation: </span>5 minutes
    </li>
    <li class="" style="color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%)">
      <span class="fw-bolder">Cooking: </span>5 minutes
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
